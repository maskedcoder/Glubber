# Set up the fields for the templates

# The top level keys are template names and
# the next level is field names. For example,
#
#     about-us:
#       title: ...
#
# The above corresponds to a template with a
# file name beginning with "about-us". The
# extension would depend on what template
# engine you are using. Also, you can see
# above that inside "about-us" is a field
# called "title".

# The name you give a field in this file must
# correspond to the variable name you use in
# your templates. All variables must be
# declared in this file. If a variable is not
# first declared here, the UI to enter data
# for it will not be created, and the variable
# will be left undefined.

# Each field is given a model, a display name,
# and a description. The model is necessary
# to validate, store, and create UI for data
# entry. he other two are optional and only
# used to help the person entering data.

# Glubber ships with some models built-in:
# - GlubberTitle
# - GlubberText
# - GlubberResource
# - GlubberHTML
# - GlubberMarkdown
